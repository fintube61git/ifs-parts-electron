**Subject: Invitation to Test an App from Dawson**

Hello,

Thank you for your interest in helping to test my new application!

To get started, we'll be using a platform called GitHub to share the test builds securely. Because the project is private, you will need a free GitHub account to access the download page.

### Step 1: Create a Free GitHub Account

1.  Go to the GitHub sign-up page: [https://github.com/signup](https://github.com/signup)
2.  **For the easiest setup, please create an account using your email, a new password, and a username.** We recommend *avoiding* the "Continue with Google" option to prevent any confusion later.
3.  Follow the instructions to complete your free account.

### Step 2: Send Me Your GitHub Username

Once you've created your account, please reply to this email with the **username** you chose. I need it to add you as a collaborator to the private project.

*If you have any trouble finding your username, just click on your profile icon in the top-right corner of the GitHub page, and it will be the first item in the menu that appears.*

Once I add you as a collaborator, you'll receive an invitation from GitHub. After you accept it, you'll have full access to the project's download page.

Thank you again for your help!
