    * **Graphical Way:** Right-click the file -> **Properties** -> **Permissions** -> check **"Allow executing file as program"**.
    * **Terminal Way:** Open the "Terminal" app, go to your Downloads folder (`cd Downloads`), and run `chmod +x TheFileName.AppImage`.
3.  **Run:** Double-click the `.AppImage` file to start it.

### macOS Instructions
Your application file will be a **`.dmg`**.

1.  **Install:** Download and open the `.dmg` file. In the window that appears, drag the application icon into your `Applications` folder.
2.  **First Run:** Go to your `Applications` folder, **right-click** the app icon, and select **"Open"**. A security warning will appear; click **"Open"** again. You only need to do this the very first time you run it.

### How to Update and Clean Up Old Versions
1.  Download the new application file from the Releases page.
2.  Follow the same installation steps for your operating system.
